# DurovisFlight

This is a Unity experimentation with the Durovis Dive SDK located here: https://www.durovis.com/en/sdk.html

Essentially, it's a Durovis Flight Scene and I recommend using the older latest version of Unity 4, located here: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive

If you are feeling bold and adventurous, you could try updating the Scene with Unity 5 (Or insert relevent version of Unity here) from this link: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
